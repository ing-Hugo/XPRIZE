# High-Precision Protein Folding Analysis Using Hybrid VQE Algorithm

Defining the hybrid Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for protein folding. Utilizing quantum circuits to optimize dihedral angles and energy states of a protein structure. Incorporating classical simulation with OpenMM to compute physical properties. The algorithm begins by downloading the Protein Data Bank (PDB) file for the target protein, here identified as 1VII. Constructing a quantum Hamiltonian based on hydrophobic and polar interactions among amino acid residues. Creating a parameterized ansatz using Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD)-inspired layers combined with dihedral angle parameters. Optimizing the ansatz parameters via the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) optimizer on a quantum backend. Mapping optimized parameters to 3D coordinates and validating the structure using OpenMM simulations.

## Image Analysis
A visual representation of the folded 1VII protein structure is provided, reflecting the optimization results.

**Figure 12**: Folded 3D structure of the 1VII protein molecule obtained from the hybrid VQE algorithm. The image highlights the optimized spatial arrangement of the 36 amino acid residues, with colors potentially indicating hydrophobic and polar regions.

The image depicts the final 3D conformation of the 1VII protein, optimized over 225.68 seconds. The low RMSD of 0.0784 ˚A indicates a highly accurate match to the native structure, as derived from the initial PDB file. The final energy of -32.118114 Hartree suggests a stable quantum state, while the validation energy of 974.46 kJ mol−1 from OpenMM confirms the physical stability of the folded structure. The visual representation likely shows the compact folding pattern, with hydrophobic residues clustering internally and polar residues exposed, consistent with the Hamiltonian’s interaction terms.
