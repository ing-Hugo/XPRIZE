# Functionality of Each Function

## `SETUP_LOGGING()`
- **Purpose**: Initializes a logging system to track the execution process, errors, and debug information.
- **Functionality**: Creates a directory `./data/vqe_logs` if it doesnâ€™t exist, sets up a logger with a timestamped log file, and configures a file handler for detailed output. Returns the logger for use in other functions.

## `DOWNLOAD_PDB(pdb_id, logger)`
- **Purpose**: Downloads a Protein Data Bank (PDB) file for a given protein ID.
- **Functionality**: Checks if the PDB file exists in `./data/`, downloads it from the RCSB database if absent, and returns the file path. Logs the download action.

## `GET_HP_SEQUENCE(pdb_id, logger)`
- **Purpose**: Converts a protein sequence into a hydrophobic-polar (HP) model.
- **Functionality**: Defines a fixed sequence (e.g., "1VII") and maps amino acids to 'H' (hydrophobic) or 'P' (polar) based on a set of hydrophobic residues. Logs the resulting HP sequence.

## `CREATE_HP_HAMILTONIAN(hp_sequence, lattice_size, logger)`
- **Purpose**: Constructs a quantum Hamiltonian for the HP model.
- **Functionality**: Calculates the number of qubits based on a lattice size, identifies hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions, and builds a SparsePauliOp with \( Z \) terms for adjacent 'H' pairs. Logs the number of terms created.

## `MAP_VQE_TO_POSITIONS(hp_sequence, parameters, lattice_size, logger)`
- **Purpose**: Maps VQE-optimized parameters to 3D lattice positions.
- **Functionality**: Generates a list of 2D coordinates (x, y, 0) on a lattice based on the sequence length and parameters, logging the mapping details.

## `CUSTOM_VQE(estimator, ansatz, hamiltonian, optimizer, logger)`
- **Purpose**: Implements a custom VQE optimization loop.
- **Functionality**: Defines an objective function to compute energy, handles NaN values with a penalty, runs the estimator on a QuantumRings backend, and optimizes parameters using SPSA. Logs debug and result information.

## `RUN_OPENMM_FOLDING(pdb_id, logger)`
- **Purpose**: Performs classical molecular dynamics folding using OpenMM.
- **Functionality**: Loads a PDB file, sets up a simulation with AMBER14 force fields, minimizes energy, and runs a 10,000-step simulation, saving trajectories and returning the potential energy in kJ/mol.

## `VALIDATE_VQE_STRUCTURE(full_sequence, hp_sequence, positions, pdb_id, logger)`
- **Purpose**: Validates the VQE-optimized structure using OpenMM.
- **Functionality**: Adjusts positions from VQE to match the PDB topology, runs a simulation with the same settings as `RUN_OPENMM_FOLDING`, and returns the energy, logging the process.

## `COMPARE_RESULTS(vqe_energy, openmm_vqe_energy, openmm_energy, logger)`
- **Purpose**: Compares energies from VQE and OpenMM simulations.
- **Functionality**: Logs the energies and attempts to calculate RMSD using VMD if available, providing a structural comparison metric.

## `RUN_VQE_PROTEIN_FOLDING(pdb_id="1VII", lattice_size=6, logger)`
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates the full VQE protein folding workflow.
- **Functionality**: Coordinates sequence processing, Hamiltonian creation, ansatz construction, VQE optimization, position mapping, and validation, timing the process and returning energies. Handles backend setup with QuantumRings.

## `Main Block`
- **Purpose**: Executes the complete simulation pipeline.
- **Functionality**: Initializes logging, runs OpenMM folding, executes VQE folding, compares results, and handles exceptions with appropriate logging.
