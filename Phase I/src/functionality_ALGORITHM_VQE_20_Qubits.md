Functionality of Each Component

hamiltonian_20 Definition

Purpose: Defines a 20-qubit Hamiltonian for the quantum system.
Functionality: Creates a SparsePauliOp with specified Pauli terms and coefficients (e.g., "ZIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII" with 0.5) to model the system's energy interactions. Prints the Hamiltonian.

Exact Ground State Calculation

Purpose: Estimates the ground-state energy of the Hamiltonian as a lower bound.
Functionality: Sums the negative coefficients of Z terms as a rough estimate and prints the result.

ansatz_20 and ansatz_transpiled_20 Setup

Purpose: Constructs and optimizes a variational quantum circuit.
Functionality: Uses EfficientSU2 to create a 20-qubit ansatz with 3 repetitions and linear entanglement, and transpiles it for optimization. Prepares it for VQE.

CustomSPSA Class

Purpose: Implements a custom Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) optimizer with adaptive decay.
Functionality: Initializes with maximum iterations, learning rate, and perturbation. The step function adjusts learning rate and perturbation over iterations, estimates the gradient, and updates parameters.

CUSTOM_VQE(estimator, ansatz, hamiltonian, optimizer)

Purpose: Executes the VQE algorithm to find the ground-state energy.
Functionality: Initializes random parameters, iterates over the optimizer's steps with adaptive learning, runs the estimator to compute energy, stores the history, and returns the final energy, parameters, and energy list. Prints iteration details.

Plotting and Output

Purpose: Visualizes and reports VQE results.
Functionality: Plots energy convergence against iterations, adds the estimated ground-state energy as a reference line, and displays the graph. Prints the final energy, error, and optimal parameters if successful.
