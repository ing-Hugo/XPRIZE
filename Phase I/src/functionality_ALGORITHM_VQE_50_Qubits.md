# Functionality of Each Component



## `hamiltonian_50` Definition
- **Purpose**: Defines a 50-qubit Hamiltonian for the quantum system.
- **Functionality**: Creates a SparsePauliOp with Z terms decreasing linearly, XX terms with a small decay, and a single YY term to model the system's energy interactions. Prints the estimated ground-state energy.

## `Exact Ground State Calculation`
- **Purpose**: Provides a predefined estimated ground-state energy.
- **Functionality**: Sets a fixed value (-7.0 Hartree) as a reference for the ground-state energy and prints it.

## `hardware_efficient_ansatz`
- **Purpose**: Constructs a hardware-efficient variational quantum circuit.
- **Functionality**: Builds a QuantumCircuit with RY rotations on all qubits per layer and CZ entangling gates in a linear chain pattern across 4 layers, parameterized by input params.

## `vqe`
- **Purpose**: Executes the VQE algorithm to find the ground-state energy.
- **Functionality**: Initializes random parameters, optimizes using COBYLA with a 1500-second timeout, runs the estimator to compute energy, stores the history, and returns the final energy, parameters, and energy list. Prints iteration details and runtime.

## `Plotting and Output`
- **Purpose**: Visualizes and reports VQE results.
- **Functionality**: Plots energy convergence against iterations, adds the estimated ground-state energy as a reference line, and displays the graph. Prints the final energy and error if successful.
